# Devsite JSilver Templates

This directory contains the jsilver templates used to generate javadocs for
devsite.  They are modified directly from the templates included in doclava.
The following javascript libraries have been removed in order to comply with
Google's policy on third party code.  All of this will need to be integrated
into devsite's core javascript framework anyway.

 * `assets/jquery-history.js` (v0.1)
 * `assets/jquery-resizable.min.js` (jQuery 1.3.2, jQuery UI 1.7.2)
 * `assets/prettify.js`
